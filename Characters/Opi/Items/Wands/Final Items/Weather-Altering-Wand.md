# Weather Altering Wand

*Wand, Rare (requires attunement)*

From the Lab of Storms and Electricity, this wand is designed to mimic the effect of the Control Weather spell, without the need to be a high level spellcaster. The wand maintains a wand-like shape, but changes its changes shape, size, and texture based on the currently produced condition. The wand may be hot or cold, wet or dry, shaking in your hand due to wind it creates, or any combination of those characteristics. The wand has 7 charges, and regains 1d6+1 charges daily at dawn. To use the wand, select an effect from the table below and expend the number of charges required by that effect. All weather effects generated by this wand happen no matter the location, inside or outside, and the effects only begin after the weather has fully changed. The weather effects created by the wand can go through walls but not ceilings. If the weather is already being affected by the wand, using it again causes the weather to transition to the new effect. If the caster leaves the effective range of the weather created by the spell, all of the weather effects immediately end.
