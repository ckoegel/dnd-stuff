# Weather Altering Wand Prototype

From the Lab of Storms and Electricity, this wand is designed to mimic the effect of the Control Weather spell, without the need to be a high-level spellcaster. This wand does not require attunement, but as a result, it is not the most reliable and is incredibly volatile. In its current state, the wand is pretty much unable to be controlled. The wand maintains a wand-like shape, but cycles through characteristics of different weather conditions and changes shape, size, and texture based on its current condition. The wand may be hot or cold, wet or dry, shaking in your hand due to the wind it creates, or any combination of those characteristics. The wand has 4 charges and regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. To use the wand you must expend a charge and roll on the table below to determine the outcome. All weather effects generated by this wand happen no matter the location, inside or outside, and the effects only begin after the weather has fully changed. The weather effects created by the wand can go through walls but not ceilings. If the weather is already being affected by the wand, using it again causes the weather to transition to the new effect. If the caster leaves the effective range of the weather created by the wand, all of the weather effects immediately end.

*This device is still in testing, roll a d100 to determine the outcome of using the wand.*

| d100 Roll | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1-20 | The current weather can be described by the DM based on the Precipitation, Temperature, and Wind Stages outlined in the Control Weather spell. Roll a d20 for each of these categories, a 10 or lower, or 11 or higher will modify the current conditions by one stage up or down respectively. The weather changes over the next 1d4 rounds, remains this way for 1 minute, and then gradually returns to its previous state. |
| 21-37 | The wand seemingly does nothing as its form remains the same in your hand. Over the next 1d4 rounds, the weather around you inside a 120 foot radius becomes clear and warm, with a very calm breeze blowing. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, at the end of this minute, roll a d10, on a one, reroll on this table to see what the weather changes to. On a 2-10, or if this entry is rerolled, the weather gradually returns to its previous state. |
| 38-46 | The wand becomes moist and begins to burn your hand. Take 1d6+2 acid damage as the wand begins to change the weather around you in a 120 foot radius. Over the next 1d4 rounds, the weather inside this radius becomes rainy and warm with a moderate wind. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, and then gradually returns to its previous state. Acidic energy radiates from the wand around you in a 20 foot radius, causing acid rain to fall from the sky in this area. Any creature not under cover or with exposed skin takes 1d4+1 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. |
| 47-55 | The wand begins to drip water and shake in your hand. Take 1d6+2 thunder damage as the wand begins to change the weather around you in a 120 foot radius. Over the next 1d4 rounds, the weather inside this radius becomes cool and stormy, with torrential rain and storm strength winds. The entire radius is now lightly obscured for the duration, causing disadvantage on perception checks that rely on sight. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, and if the space around you is enclosed, water may begin to fill the room slowly over this time. It is up to the DM to determine how quickly the water will rise and the effects of this. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, then gradually returns to its previous state, but leaves the rainwater behind. |
| 56-64 | The wand becomes extremely hot to the touch. Take 1d6+2 fire damage as the wand begins to change the weather around you in a 120 foot radius. Over the next 1d4 rounds, the weather inside this radius becomes desert-like, with clear skies, no wind, and unbearable heat. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, and then gradually returns to its previous state. At the beginning of each of your turns during this minute, roll a d10, on a one, the wand casts the Burning Hands spell at first level in a random direction, which counts as your action for that turn. |
| 65-73 | The wand becomes incredibly cold to the touch. Take 1d6+2 cold damage as the wand begins to change the weather around you in a 120 foot radius. Over the next 1d4 rounds, the weather inside this radius becomes blizzard-like, with arctic cold temperatures, strong winds, and heavy snow. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, and then gradually returns to its previous state. The entire radius is now lightly obscured for the duration, causing disadvantage on perception checks that rely on sight. The effects of the storm are stronger closer to you, causing each creature within a 20 foot radius of you not equipped for cold weather to make a DC 12 Constitution save at the beginning of each of its turns, taking 1d4+1 cold damage on a fail. |
| 74-82 | The wand becomes warm and starts to spark. Take 1d6+2 lightning damage as the wand begins to change the weather around you in a 120 foot radius. Over the next 1d4 rounds, the weather inside this radius turns into a lightning storm, with an overcast sky, hot temperature, and moderate wind. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, and then gradually returns to its previous state. The storm's energy is stronger directly around you. At the beginning of each of your turns during this minute, number the 8 adjacent spaces to you, then roll a d8. Lightning strikes this space, dealing 1d8+2 lightning damage to any creatures in this space. If a creature is struck by lightning, it must succeed on a DC12 Constitution save or be stunned until the end of its next turn. If lightning would strike a space adjacent to a creature wearing metal armour, and nothing in the adjacent space is wearing metal armour, the lightning strikes that creature instead. |
| 83-91 | The wand becomes cold and shakes in your hand. Take 1d6+2 cold damage as the wand begins to change the weather around you in a 120 foot radius. Over the next 1d4 rounds, the weather inside this radius becomes an ice storm, with driving hail, cold temperatures, and strong wind. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, and then gradually returns to its previous state. During this time, the effects of the storm are stronger closer to you, and creatures within a 20 foot radius of you must make a DC12 Dexterity save to avoid getting hit by hail at the beginning of each of its turns, taking 1d6+1 bludgeoning damage and 1d4+1 cold damage on a fail. |
| 92-100 | The wand begins to shake violently. Make a DC12 Sleight of Hand check, on a fail, the wand flies out of your hand in a random direction and flies up to 15 feet away unless it hits something on its way. The weather around you in a 120 foot radius becomes incredibly windy, with a warm temperature and overcast skies. The weather remains like this for 1 minute, and then gradually returns to its previous state. At the start of each of your turns during this time, roll a d4, a tornado forms at a point 25 feet away from you in the cardinal direction corresponding to the number on the die (1=N, 2=E, 3=S, 4=W). If a tornado already exists at this spot, nothing happens. The tornado takes up a 15 x 15 ft square centered on the point and extends upward to the ceiling or 100ft; this area becomes difficult terrain. Freestanding objects within range are instantly pulled to the center of the tornado. Creatures within range outside of the center point must succeed on a DC12 Strength check at the start of each of their turns or be pulled to the center of the tornado. Creatures in the center are Restrained and must succeed on a DC12 Strength check to free themselves. If there are any other objects or creatures at the center of the tornado, each creature takes 1d6+2 force damage at the start of every turn they spend in the center. If an object or group of objects in the center is of size small or bigger, the creatures in the center get half cover from these flying objects. |
