# Shapeshifting Shortsword Prototype

Plans for the Shapeshifting Shortsword may or may not have been stolen from a Simic Lab. However, they have been modified by the Laboratory of Plasma-Dermatology to produce an obviously superior weapon. To remain inconspicuous, the sword physically appears like a normal shortsword when not in use, though the sword contains DNA and particles from many different creatures and will take the form of a specific one for each attack it makes. Currently, the technology is not in place to allow the wielder to choose what the sword forms to, so the sword will randomly become different creature appendages upon use. Proficiency with a shortsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. Make a melee weapon attack against a creature, on a hit, refer to the table for what form the sword takes.

*This weapon is still in testing, roll a d100 to determine the form the sword takes.*
| d100 Roll | Sword Form and Effect |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| 1-12 | The Shortsword remains a normal shortsword. You attack as though you are weilding a regular shortsword, dealing 1d6+Str/Dex piercing damage. |
| 13-20 | The sword takes the form of a small Water Weird. The weird slams into the attacked creature, dealing 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage. The creature must succeed on a DC13 Strength save or be pushed backwards 10 feet. |
| 21-28 | The sword takes the form of a small Poison Weird. The weird slams into the attacked creature, dealing 1d6+3 bludgeoning damage. The creature must succeed on a DC13 Constitution save or become poisoned. The creature may reattempt this save at the beginning of each of its turns until no longer poisoned. |
| 29-36 | The sword forms into the tentacle of a Sharktocrab. The tentacle wraps around the attacked creature, dealing 1d8+3 bludgeoning damage and grappling the creature until you make another attack with this sword. |
| 37-44 | The sword forms into the head of a Plesiosaurus. The head bites the attacked creature, dealing 2d6+2 piercing damage. The creature must succeed on a DC13 wisdom save or become frightened of you. The creature may reattempt this save at the beginning of each of its turns until no longer frightened or you unequip the sword. |
| 45-52 | The sword forms into the arm of a Galvanice Weird. The icy and sparking arm slams into the attacked creature, dealing 1d6+2 bludgeoning damage, 1d4 lightning damage, and 1d4 cold damage. The creature must succeed on a DC13 Constitution save or lose the ability to take reactions until your next turn. |
| 53-60 | The sword forms into the head of a Crocanura. The head exhales a spray of acid onto the attacked creature. The creature must make a DC13 Dexterity save, taking 3d8 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. |
| 61-68 | The sword forms into the arm of a Blistercoil Weird. The fiery steaming arm slams into the attacked creature, dealing 1d8+3 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 fire damage. If you roll a 6 on the fire die, the creature is now on fire until an Action is taken to douse the fire. The creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until the fire is put out. |
| 69-76 | The sword forms into the arm of a Fluxcharger. The arm releases an arc of lightning that strikes the attacked creature, dealing 2d10 lightning damage. Creatures within 5 feet of the attacked creature other than you must succeed on a DC13 Dexterity save or take 1d10 lightning damage as well. |
| 77-84 | The sword forms into the head of a Killer Whale. The head bites the attacked creature, dealing 4d6+4 piercing damage. |
| 85-92 | The sword forms into the wing of an Arclight Phoenix. Lightning jumps from the wing to the attacked creature, dealing 3d8 lightning damage. The lightning then jumps to another creature of your choice within 10 feet of the attacked creature. That creature must succeed on a DC13 Dexterity save or take 1d8 lightning damage. After using this form, roll a d20, on a 1, the phoenix DNA inside the sword dies, causing the wings to explode. Every creature within 15 feet of the sword must make a DC13 Dexterity save, taking 4d8 lightning damage on a fail or half as much on a success. This form is now unusable. If it is rolled, roll again to determine a different creature. |
