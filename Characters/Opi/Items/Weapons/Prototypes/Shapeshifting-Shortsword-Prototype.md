# Shapeshifting Shortsword Prototype

Plans for the Shapeshifting Shortsword may or may not have been stolen from a Simic Lab. However, they have been modified to produce an obviously superior weapon. To remain inconspicuous, the sword physically appears like a normal shortsword when not in use, though the sword contains DNA and particles from many different creatures and will take the form of a specific one for each attack it makes. Currently, the technology is not in place to allow the wielder to choose what the sword forms to, so the sword will randomly become different creature appendages upon use. You are proficient with this sword if you are proficient with Shortswords. Make a melee weapon attack against a creature, on a hit, refer to the table for what form the sword takes.

*This weapon is still in testing, roll a d100 to determine the form the sword takes.*
