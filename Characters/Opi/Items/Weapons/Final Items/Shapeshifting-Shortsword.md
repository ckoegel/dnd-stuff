# Shapeshifting Shortsword

*Wondrous item, Very Rare*

Plans for the Shapeshifting Shortsword may or may not have been stolen from a Simic Lab. However, they have been modified by the Laboratory of Plasma-Dermatology to produce an obviously superior weapon. To remain inconspicuous, the sword physically appears like a normal shortsword when not in use, though the sword contains DNA and particles from many different creatures and will take the form of a specific one for each attack it makes. Proficiency with a shortsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The sword has 8 charges and regains 1d8 charges daily at dawn. You may expend a charge to choose the creature the sword will form to, refer to the table for the particular effect of each creature. If the sword reaches 0 charges left, roll a d20, on a 1 the sword loses its magic and turns into a normal shortsword. You may also choose to have the sword not transform, using no charge, and making it function as a +1 shortsword.
