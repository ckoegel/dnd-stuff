# Pocket Mizzium Mortar

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

From the Laboratory of Pyrology, the Pocket Mizzium Mortar is an 8 inch long, 2 inch diameter tube made from mizzium that shoots small balls of molten mizzium. Designed to be a more portable version of the full size mizzium mortar. The mortar has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. Can be used as an action to start fires or as an attack.

The device can be used to make 2 different types of attacks and 1 action:
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Molten Spray | Attack | You can expend 1 charge as an action to let loose a 15-foot cone of molten mizzium. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The charge is used regardless of the result of this attack. |
| Mizzium Pillar | Attack | You can expend 1 charge as an action to launch a molten projectile to a point you can see within 30 feet of you. The projectile creates a 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-high fiery cylinder centered on that point. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The charge is used regardless of the result of this attack. |
| Light Fire | Action | You can expend 1 charge as an action to light a fire, the device has a 10ft range. Make a DC10 Sleight of Hand check to attempt to ignite any one flammable object in range. On a pass, a roll of 21 or higher on a d100 will successfully ignite the object, otherwise the mortar fizzles and fails. Expend the charge only if it succeeds in igniting. |
