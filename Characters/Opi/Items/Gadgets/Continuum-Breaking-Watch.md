# Continuum Breaking Watch

From the Laboratory of Continuism, the Continuum Breaking Watch is designed to allow you to exceed the boundaries of time. It can be used as a free action on your turn. Turning the dial on the watch will cause time to slow around you, allowing you to perform actions at unrivaled speed. When not used, the watch functions as a normal watch, and is made of gold, bronze and leather. The inner gears of the watch are visible behind the watch face.

*This device is still in testing, roll a d100 to determine the outcome of using the watch.*
| d100 Roll | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1-10 | Continuum modifying particles are fragile and volatile. The watch explodes upon use, sending glass shards flying out in a 5ft radius around the user. Creatures within the radius must make a DC12 Dex save or take 1d6 piercing damage. |
| 11-30 | The watch malfunctions, accidentally speeding up time for you. Your turn immediately ends and you have the effects of the stunned condition until the end of your next turn. No spells can remove this effect as you are simply travelling thru time faster than those around you. |
