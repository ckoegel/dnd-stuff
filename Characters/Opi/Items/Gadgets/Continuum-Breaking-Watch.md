# Continuum Breaking Watch

From the Laboratory of Continuism, the Continuum Breaking Watch is designed to allow you to exceed the boundaries of time. When not in use, the watch functions as a normal watch, and is made of gold, bronze and leather. The inner gears of the watch are visible behind the watch face.

The watch has 4 charges, and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. As a free action on your turn, you may expend one charge to turn the dial on the watch, causing time to slow around you and allowing you to perform actions at unrivaled speed.

*This device is still in testing, roll a d100 to determine the outcome of using the watch.*
| d100 Roll | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1-10 | Continuum modifying particles are fragile and volatile. The watch explodes upon use, sending glass shards flying out in a 5ft radius around the user. Creatures within the radius must make a DC12 Dex save or take 1d6 piercing damage. The watch is now unusable until it is repaired by an Izzet engineer or the Mending Spell. |
| 11-30 | The watch malfunctions, accidentally speeding up time for you. Your turn immediately ends and you have the effects of the stunned condition until the end of your next turn. No spells can remove this effect as you are simply travelling thru time faster than those around you. |
| 31-60 | You watch as time slows around you, kind of.... It seems as though the watch didn't work to its fullest potential. Nonetheless, with your enhanced perception of time, you may take an extra bonus action on your current turn, or an extra reaction in the current round. |
| 61-80 | Time has instantly become slower for you, and you are able to take an extra bonus action and reaction on your next 1d4 turns/rounds, beggining with your current turn and the current round. |
| 81-95 | You watch the world around you move in super slow motion, allowing you to see movements as though they are barely moving at all. For the next 1d4 rounds, you may take an extra action on your turn. Treat any attacks you make during this time as though your opponent is Stunned. Attacks made against you during this time have disadvantage, as you are nothing more than a blur to their eyes. |
| 96-100 | Time all but stops for you. On your current turn you may take 3 extra actions. This *does* allow spellcasters to cast more than 1 leveled spell on their turn. Treat any attacks you make during this turn as though your opponent is Stunned, Blinded, and Deafened, as you are literally inconceivable to those around you. |
