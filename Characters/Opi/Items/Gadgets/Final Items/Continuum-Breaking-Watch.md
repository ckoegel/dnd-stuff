# Continuum Breaking Watch

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

From the Laboratory of Continuism, the Continuum Breaking Watch is designed to allow you to exceed the boundaries of time. When not in use, the watch functions as a normal watch, and is made of gold, bronze and leather. The inner gears of the watch are visible behind the watch face.

The watch has 4 charges, and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. As a free action on your turn, you may expend one charge to turn the dial on the watch, causing time to slow around you and allowing you to perform actions at unrivaled speed. Time all but stops for you. On your current turn you may take 3 extra actions. This *does* allow spellcasters to cast more than 1 leveled spell on their turn. Treat any attacks you make during this turn as though your opponent is Stunned, Blinded, and Deafened, as you are literally inconceivable to those around you.
