# Spatial Recombination Stone

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

From the Lab of Orientation, this smooth, 2 inch brown stone contains a mixture of magic and wires. It gives off a faint bronze glow, and if you listen closely, you can hear the whirring of the parts inside. It can be thrown to teleport creatures to different locations, and sometimes planes. As an action on your turn, you may throw the stone up to 4 times your Strength score feet in any direction. The stone has 6 charges and regains 1d6 charges daily at dawn. Choose the teleportation effect you would like to use from the table and expend the numbers of charges for the respective effect. If the stone successfully teleports a creature, the stone reappears in the throwers hand.

| Name(Charges) | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Teleport Self(1) | Throw the stone to a desired location within range, this location can be on the ground or any other solid object. You may not choose to teleport to a midair location, though as long as the stone collides with a solid object, it will function. Upon the stones arrival, the thrower teleports to the stones location, and the stone reappears in the users hand. |
| Teleport Other(1) | Throw the stone at a creature within range, if the creature is unwilling to be teleported, make a ranged attack roll against them, on a hit the creature is teleported to the closest unoccupied space to you, this does include midair. If the stone misses, it returns to the throwers hand. |
| Delayed Teleport(1) | Throw or place the stone at a desired location within range. The stone will teleport the next creature to touch it within an hour to the closest unoccupied space to you, regardless of how far away you are, but only if you are on the same plane. If the stone is not touched within 1 hour, it reappears in the users hand. The user can also pick up the stone at any time to cancel this effect. |
| Teleport Group(?) | Throw the stone to a desired location within range, this location can be on the ground or any other solid object. You may not choose to teleport to a midair location. Upon the stones arrival, the thrower along with any creatures it is in direct contact with, teleport to the stones location, and the stone reappears in the users hand. This effect uses a number of charges equal to the number of creatures teleported. |
| Teleport Self to Ethereal Plane(2) | With the stone in hand, you may choose this effect to teleport yourself to your current location in the Ethereal Plane. If you are already in the Ethereal Plane, this teleports you to the nearest unoccupied space to you in the Material Plane. You must use another spell or use of this effect to get back to the Material Plane if you desire, so don't get stuck in the Ethereal Plane with no charges or spell slots! |
| Teleport Other to Ethereal Plane(2) | Throw the stone at a creature within range, if the creature is unwilling to be teleported, make a ranged attack roll against them, on a hit the creature is teleported to their current location in the Ethereal Plane. If the creature is already in the Ethereal Plane, this teleports them to the closest unoccupied space to them in the Material Plane. Creatures teleported this way do *not* automatically come back to the Material Plane. |
