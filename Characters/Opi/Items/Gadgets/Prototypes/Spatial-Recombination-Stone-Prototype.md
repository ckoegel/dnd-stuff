# Spatial Recombination Stone Prototype

From the Lab of Orientation, this smooth, 2 inch brown stone contains a mixture of magic and wires. It gives off a faint bronze glow, and if you listen closely, you can hear the whirring of the parts inside. It can be thrown to teleport creatures to different locations, and sometimes planes. As an action on your turn, you may throw the stone up to 4 times your Strength score feet in any direction. Upon colliding with something, the stone will cause one of the teleportation effects in the table. Currently, the stone is not very good at relocating multiple creatures, so it often attempts to teleport them to the exact same location, which can cause some issues with creatures being inside of others. It seems as though the creatures are merely pushed apart, so this is not a *major* health concern. If the stone successfully teleports the thrower, the stone reappears in the throwers hand.

*This device is still in testing, roll a d100 to determine the stones effect.*

| d100 Roll | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1-10 | If the stone collides with anything other than a creature&#x00B9;, it does absolutely nothing and must be retrieved to be used again. |
| 11-20 | If the stone collides with anything other than a creature&#x00B9;, it does absolutely nothing, but teleports itself back into the throwers hand. After hitting or missing a creature, the stone teleports itself back into the throwers hand. |
| 21-40 | The stone lands at the desired location and attempts to teleport itself back to the thrower. Instead of teleporting only itself, it brings along the next creature to touch the stone within 1 minute. The first creature to touch the stone after it is thrown is teleported to the space the stone was thrown from, this includes the thrower of the stone. If the stone hits a creature&#x00B9;, that creature is instantly teleported to the location the stone was thrown from. After a creature is teleported by the stone, if there is a creature within the space the stone was thrown from, both that creature and the teleported one take 3d6 force damage as they are pushed apart. If the stone is not touched within 1 minute, it teleports back to the space it was thrown from. |
| 41-50 | The stone lands at the space desired and attempts to teleport the thrower to its location. If the stone lands on the ground, the user is teleported to the stones location... 30 feet in the air. If the stone instead hits a creature&#x00B9;, both the thrower and the hit creature are teleported to this height. The teleported creature/s begin to fall immediately and if more than 1 creature is teleported, they attempt to occupy the same space in midair, and take 3d6 force damage as they are pushed apart. |
| 51-60 | The stone lands at the space desired and attempts to teleport the thrower to its location. If the stone lands on the ground, the user is teleported to the stones location... in the ethereal plane. If the stone instead hits a creature&#x00B9;, both the thrower and the hit creature are teleported to the ethereal plane. Once in the ethereal plane, the creature/s teleported remain there for 1d4 rounds, before teleporting back into the material plane at the spot the stone landed. If more than 1 creature is teleported, when they come back to the material plane, they attempt to occupy the same space, and take 3d6 force damage as they are pushed apart. |
| 61-70 | The stone lands at the space desired&#x00B9; and instantly teleports the thrower to its location, reappearing in the throwers hand. If there is a creature in the location the stone lands, the thrower is teleported to the nearest unoccupied space to the stone. After the stone reappears in your hand, you notice the stone has stopped glowing and whirring. The stone is now unusable until it is repaired by an Izzet engineer or the Mending Spell. |
| 71-100 | The stone lands at the space desired&#x00B9; and instantly teleports the thrower to its location, reappearing in the throwers hand. If there is a creature in the location the stone lands, the thrower is teleported to the nearest unoccupied space to the stone. |

&#x00B9; If the stone is thrown and would collide with a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC12 Dexterity save or be hit by the stone, taking 1d4+2 bludgeoning damage and stopping the flight of the stone.
