# Mizzium Grappling Hook Prototype

From the Laboratory of Metallurgy, the Mizzium Grappling Hook can be mounted on a mizzium apparatus to free up hands, though you must have a free hand to operate and climb with it. Consists of a mizzium grappling hook and 30ft of rope. It can be shot as an action and if hooked on top of a wall can give a climbing speed of half of your movement. A bonus action can be used to retract the hook if it is not lodged in something. A bonus action can be taken by the user or someone it is lodged on to remove it. If used to climb, it does not need to be retracted if the user climbs to where the hook is lodged.

*This device is still in testing, roll a d100 to determine the outcome of the shot.*
| d100 Roll | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1-10 | The hook shoots backwards, entangling the user in its rope, leaving the user restrained. They can untangle themselves or be untangled by someone else as an action and must retract the hook before it can be used again. |
| 11-20 | The hook shoots in a random direction at an ally within range. Make a ranged attack roll against the players AC. If it hits them, it deals 1d4 piercing damage and is lodged on them. |
| 21-30 | The hook shoots in a random direction at an ally within range. They must make a DC12 Dex save to avoid it. If it hits them, they are restrained. They can untangle themselves or be untangled by someone else as an action. |
| 31-50 | The hook shoots where aimed, and if lodged, immediately retracts, pulling the user unwillingly to the hooks location. The user must make a DC12 strength check to avoid being knocked prone upon arrival. |
