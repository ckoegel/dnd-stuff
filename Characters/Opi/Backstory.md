## Backstory for Opi Oyds

### Early Life
I grew up in the Bulwark in the 4th precinct. My childhood friend(Raka) is more chaotic than me and not interested in learning speelcasting or inventions. He's now a higher up in the Shatterbang Brothers, one of the goblin gangs thats prominent in the 4th precinct. Because of him, I'm very comfortable on Tin St and never have to worry about goblin gangs. I hang out with Raka from time to time and we're still good friends.

My dad worked his way up in the Izzet League, eventually working in Nivix and my parents moved to Plaza South in the 1st precinct because they were well off. When I was young, I wanted to be just like my dad, which was only fueled by our shared innate gift of sorcerous spellcasting. I'm not the smartest and never have been, and intelligence is highly sought after in the Izzet League. I was never that good in school, and spent most of my time goofing off with Raka, which was fun, but also bothered me that I couldnt see a definite future in the Izzet League for me.

One day, I was visting my dad at work and was playing outside when I ran into Niv-MIzzet. He told me he saw potential in me and said that my curiosity and chaos reminded him of himself when he was younger.
He said that he felt like I might work alongisde him someday. This really boosted my confidence and prompted me to turn myself around in school and apply to Prism.

### Recent Life
My father passed away a few months ago, and I was happy to make him proud that I had just begun leading a new research team in the league. I still visit my mother fairly often, but she is old and doesn't get out much.

My parents moved when I went off to college at Prism University. While at college, there was a vedalken wizard(Pirdan) in my classes who wanted to be an Izzet engineer. He was wayy smarter than me and was at the top of our class and shit on me while we were there. He also used to work at the Millennial Restaurant, which he thinks is much more of an achievement than I do.... We were fake friends and he definitely thought he was better than me because he was smarter. He now works as a manager Nivix and is still my rival. I can't help but compare myself to him especially since hes followed a similar path to my dad.

A couple years ago, when I was recently graduated and starting in the Izzet League, a friend of Raka that I had met a couple times approached me to ask for a weapon. His name is Klex, a goblin fighter, and he is a minor Gruul clan cheifton whom I'd grown up near since he also lived in the Bulwark. I helped him get a hold of a Mizzium mortar and we are on good terms. 

I started working in the Izzet League as an R&D tester in the Metallurgy Lab, which is how I got that mortar for Klex. I loved testing new weapons and kept getting my arm blown off so I would wear a temporary prosthetic arm for testing. I started to talk to groups from other labs abot testing their equipment, and over a year and a half, gained 3 renown and have become the lead of the new Research and Testing team. The R&TT, as I like to call it, collaborates with other labs to test new gear and gadgets, and helps to create prototypes for devices they are designing. My prosthetic arm became somewhat of a running joke, so when I got Rank 1 and began working on my Mizzium Apparatus, I decided to modify it to become a bionic arm instead of a harness. I've been ideating and tinkering with it to slowly try to add more modifications that I test out every now and then. I made the apparatus with my supervisor, Hephest. 

About 2 months ago, when messing with wild magic in our lab, my skin turned bright blue, and no one in our lab had a spell slot for a Remove Curse, so I figured I'd just leave it until the next day.
That night, I met Raka for drinks on Tin St and he thought it looked sick, so I've kept my skin blue ever since.

Hephest sent me a memo earlier this week telling me he wants me to start doing field work.

## For Connor
Ik Jeremy is in the Gruul clans, so Klex could tie in with him, with him either being someone we can work with, or he might oppose Jeremy and cause tension.
